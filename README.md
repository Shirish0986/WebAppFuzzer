# Web Application Fuzzer with Machine Learning and Security Analysis

This project is a comprehensive web application fuzzer prototype designed to detect security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, and more. It incorporates machine learning for anomaly detection, static and dynamic analysis, and generates detailed reports of the vulnerabilities found.

## Features
- **Web Application Fuzzing**: Scans web applications for common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, and directory traversal.
- **Crawling and Enumeration**: Discovers all pages, forms, and input fields in the web application.
- **Payload Injection**: Injects attack payloads into forms and input fields to test security vulnerabilities.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes ML techniques to analyze responses and detect anomalies in the application.
- **Static Analysis**: Runs `Bandit` and `Pylint` to check the security and quality of the codebase.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generates detailed PDF reports listing identified vulnerabilities.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new attack vectors, payloads, and testing techniques.
- **Web Interface (Optional)**: A Flask-based web interface for running scans and viewing results.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Chrome WebDriver for Selenium
- Google Chrome browser
